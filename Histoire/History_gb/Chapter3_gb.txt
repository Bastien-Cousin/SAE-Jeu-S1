Progression 70% | ~~~~~~~~~~ Chapter 3 : The final boss ~~~~~~~~~~

70% | Here you are on the final floor. The atmosphere is much heavier than on the previous floors... The room is huge, and in the center you can see a large throne with its back to you.
What do you want to do?
- Call him to turn around (1)
- Step forward cautiously (2)


**Answers (between () = not shown.) :**

(call him to turn around)
0% | You shouted too loudly, guards came immediately, YOU'RE DEAD...
(step forward cautiously)
75% | As you step forward, you begin to see the silhouette of the man on your throne: much taller and older than you, he was waiting to fight you...

The man rises and steps around his throne to face you. It's going to be quite a fight...

Your weapon begins to glow strangely against him...

The fight begins!
