**Door Riddle 1:**

The door seems to be closed, and ask to find the hidden word using the phrases:

“I'm often made of wood or iron. I open with a key. Inside me, treasures or secrets....
But beware, I can be heavy and locked.”

Any ideas? (no determiner in front)

Ooh!!! The door opened, well done !!!!

The door didn't open, you must have made a mistake somewhere.


**Door Riddle 2:**

The door appears to be closed and requires you to complete a logical sequence of Roman numerals...

On the door, it says: “II, III, V, VIII, ...”.

What should we put in place of the “...”?
